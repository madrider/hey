1. What does this algorithm computes?

   Ans. The algorithm is to compute the difference between the max and min element in the array



2. What is its basic operation?

   Ans. the basic operation is to create minimum and maximum variables.



3. Check the no of times the basic operation is executed depends only on the size
      of an input or on any other parameter.

   Ans. It depends upon the number of terms given in an array.



4. Set up a sum/recurrence, expressing the number of times the basic operation is
      executed. 

   Ans. It is executed n-1 times.



5. What is the efficiency class of the given algorithm?
   Ans. It has an average efficiency.
